## UI
After logging in, the system will fetch required data from the backend after which you will be greeted with the dashboard's homepage. This page contains two tables. The top one containing alerts with details and a location finder. The bottom table contains a list of all users with real-time status updates and heart rates.

### Alerts
Alerts can be dismissed by clicking on the actions tab and clicking **Marked As Resolved**. This not only deletes the alert, but it resets the user's status to normal. This is important because once a heart rate or location alert is received, no new alerts will be generated until the status of the user is cleared. 

A map view of the user's location at the time the alert was generated can be viewed by clicking **View** in an alert entry.

The *Realtime Status* at the top of the dashboard indicates that the real-time alert system is functioning correctly if it is green and displays *Connected*. Disruptions such as an internet connection loss will result in the real-time alert system beign cancelled. This will be indicated by the *Realtime Status* displaying a red dot and *Disconnected* message. Please check your internet connection and refresh the application to troubleshoot and re-establish the real-time connection.
