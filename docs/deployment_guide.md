# Step 1: Front-end Deployment
In this step we will use the Amplify console to deploy and build the front-end application automatically.

# Step 2: Deploy the Kinesis Data Streams



# Step 3: Deploy the Lambdas
## 3.1: Creating the Layer
When data is sent from a wearable device to the AWS IoT Core, it gets sent through the Kinesis Data Stream which then triggers a Lambda function for data processing. The Layer file contains the dependencies needed for all the Lambda functions.
