# Requirements
Before you deploy, you must have the following in place:
*  [AWS Account](https://aws.amazon.com/account/) 
*  [GitHub Account](https://github.com/) 
*  [Node 10 or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 
*  [Amplify CLI 4.13.1 or greater installed and configured](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart#quickstart) 
*  Please create a new Google Maps API Key by following the instructions here: https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key
   
   Please navigate to your project on the [Google Cloud Platform Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). Then click on the top left menu button and select **APIs and Services**. Click on the **+ ENABLE APIS AND SERVICES** button at the top of the page. 
   Then search for and enable the following APIs:
      - Maps Javascript API
      - Places API


# Step 1: Front-end Deployment
In this step we will use the Amplify console to deploy and build the front-end application automatically. 

[![One-click deployment](https://oneclick.amplifyapp.com/button.svg)](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home#/deploy?repo=https://github.com/UBC-CIC/Mobile_Health_Monitoring_Platform)

1. **1-click deployment** button above. Make sure to start the deployment before continuing. 
2. Go to the [Amplify Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify/home).
3. Select the **MHMP** app.
4. Wait until **Provision, Build, Deploy and Verify** are all green. 
5. Click on the **Backend environments** tab.
6. Click on **File storage**.
7. Copy the bucket name Amplify created.  You will need this information for setting the environemnt variables in the next step.

9. Please add the following environment variables:
   ```javascript
   Variable: REACT_APP_AWS_S3_BUCKET        Value: <Name Of The S3 Bucket You Noted Down In The Previous Step>
   Variable: REACT_APP_AWS_S3_REGION        Value: ca-central-1
   Variable: REACT_APP_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY  Value: <The Google Maps API Key You Created Earlier>
   ```
10. Click **Save**.

# Step 2: Kinesis Data Stream and Firehose Deployment



# Step 3: Lambda Functions Deployment
## 3.1: Creating the Layer
When data is sent from a wearable device to the AWS IoT Core, it gets sent through the Kinesis Data Stream which then triggers a Lambda function for data processing. The Layer file contains the dependencies needed for all the Lambda functions. 

ðŸ““ **Note**: If you havenâ€™t cloned the repo yet, the following steps require the files to be saved locally in your computer.

1. In the AWS Console, navigate to the AWS Lambda Services page, then click **Layers** under *Additional resources* in the left-hand menu.

2. Click on **Create Layer** and fill out the required fields. Select the "Upload a .zip file" option. Upload the "nodejs.zip" file located at the */backend/LambdaLayers/MHMP_NodeModules_Layer* folder of the MHMP project. This zip file contains the node modules that are required for the Lambda functions we will create in the following steps. Finally, in the *Compatible runtimes* field, select "Node.js 12.x" and "Node.js 10.x".

3. Click **Create**.

## 3.2: Creating the Lambda Functions
We will create three different Lambda functions. One will process the data in our Kinesis Data Stream and check for geofence/location anomalies, one will run every five minutes and check for heart rate anomalies, and another function will run hourly to check the device activity.

### A. Create the Data Processing Lambda Function

1. In the AWS Console, naviagte to the IAM Services page.
2. In the left-hand menu, click **Roles** located under the *Access management* tab.
3. Click **Create role**.
4. Under *Select type of trusted entity*, choose **AWS Service**. Under *Choose a use case*, select **Lambda**. Click **Next: Permissions**.
5. In the Search field, type "AWSLambdaKinesis" then select the **AWSLambdaKinesisExecutionRole** policy option. Click **Next: Tags** then **Next: Review**.

6. Choose a *Role name* then click **Create role**.
7. In the *Roles* page, search for your newly created role and click on it.
8. In the *Permissions* tab, click **Add inline policy**.

9. In the *Visual editor* tab, click on **Choose a service**, then in the search field, type "DynamoDB" then click the *DynamoDB* option.
10. Next, in the *Actions* section, under *Manual actions*, select the "All DynamoDB actions" option.
11. Next, in the *Resources* section, select the *Specific* option.



7. In the Lambda Services page of the AWS Console, click on the **Create Function** button.
8. Select the **Author from scratch** option. Choose a Function name. Select *Node.js 12.x* as the Runtime. Expand the *Change default execution role* section. Select
